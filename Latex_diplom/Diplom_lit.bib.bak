  abstract = {We propose a novel cheminformatics approach that combines structure and ligand-based design to identify target-specific pharmacophores with well-defined exclusion ability. Our strategy includes the prediction of selective interactions, developing structure, and knowledge-based selective pharmacophore models, followed by database screening and molecular docking. This unique strategy was employed in addressing the off-target toxicity of Gsk3$\beta$ and CDKs. The connections of Gsk3$\beta$ in eukaryotic cell apoptosis and the extensive potency of Gsk3$\beta$ inhibitors to block cell death have made it a potential drug-discovery target for many grievous human disorders. Gsk3$\beta$ is phylogenetically very closely related to the CDKs, such as CDK1 and CDK2, which are suggested to be the off-target proteins of Gsk3$\beta$ inhibitors. Here, we have employed novel computational approaches in designing the ligand candidates that are potentially inhibitory against Gsk3$\beta$, with well-defined the exclusion ability to CDKs. A structure-ligand -based selective pharmacophore was modeled. This model was used to retrieve molecules from the zinc database. The hits retrieved were further screened by molecular docking and protein--ligand interaction fingerprints. Based on these results, four molecules were predicted as selective Gsk3$\beta$ antagonists. It is anticipated that this unique approach can be extended to investigate any protein--ligand specificity.},

This chapter elaborates protein structure prediction using Rosetta. Double-blind assessments of protein structure prediction methods have indicated that the Rosetta algorithm is perhaps the most successful current method for de novo protein structure prediction. In the Rosetta method, short fragments of known proteins are assembled by a Monte Carlo strategy to yield native-like protein conformations. Using only sequence information, successful Rosetta predictions yield models with typical accuracies of 3–6 A˚ Cα root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the experimentally determined structures for contiguous segments of 60 or more residues. For each structure prediction, many short simulations starting from different random seeds are carried out to generate an ensemble of decoy structures that have both favorable local interactions and protein-like global properties. This set is then clustered by structural similarity to identify the broadest free energy minima. The effectiveness of conformation modification operators for energy function optimization is also described in this chapter.},

Crystal structures are now available for rhodopsin, adrenergic, and adenosine receptors in both inactive and activated forms, as well as for chemokine, dopamine, and histamine receptors in inactive conformations. Here we review common structural features, outline the scope of structural diversity of GPCRs at different levels of homology, and briefly discuss the impact of the structures on drug discovery. Given the current set of GPCR crystal structures, a distinct modularity is now being observed between the extracellular (ligand-binding) and intracellular (signaling) regions. The rapidly expanding repertoire of GPCR structures provides a solid framework for experimental and molecular modeling studies, and helps to chart a roadmap for comprehensive structural coverage of the whole superfamily and an understanding of GPCR biological and therapeutic mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Including closely related subtype homology models, this coverage amounts to approximately 12\% of the human GPCR superfamily. The adrenergic, rhodopsin, and adenosine receptor systems are also described by agonist-bound active-state structures, including a structure of the receptor–G protein complex for the β2-adrenergic receptor. Biochemical and biophysical techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance and hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry, are providing complementary insights into ligand-dependent dynamic equilibrium between different functional states. Additional details revealed by high-resolution structures illustrate the receptors as allosteric machines that are controlled not only by ligands but also by ions, lipids, cholesterol, and water. This wealth of data is helping redefine our knowledge of how GPCRs recognize such a diverse array of ligands and how they transmit signals 30 angstroms across the cell membrane; it also is shedding light on a structural basis of GPCR allosteric modulation and biased signaling. },

Despite tremendous successes of GPCR crystallography, the receptors with available structures represent only a small fraction of human GPCRs. An important role of the modeling community is to maximize structural insights for the remaining receptors and complexes. The community-wide GPCR Dock assessment was established to stimulate and monitor the progress in molecular modeling and ligand docking for GPCRs. The four targets in the present third assessment round presented new and diverse challenges for modelers, including prediction of allosteric ligand interaction and activation states in 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors 1B and 2B, and modeling by extremely distant homology for smoothened receptor. Forty-four modeling groups participated in the assessment. State-of-the-art modeling approaches achieved close-to-experimental accuracy for small rigid orthosteric ligands and models built by close homology, and they correctly predicted protein fold for distant homology targets. Predictions of long loops and GPCR activation states remain unsolved problems.},

Our results show, with high bootstrap support, five main families, named glutamate, rhodopsin, adhesion, frizzled/taste2, and secretin, forming the GRAFS classification system. The rhodopsin family is the largest and forms four main groups with 13 sub-branches.

We also searched for {\textquotedblleft}fingerprint{\textquotedblright} motifs using Hidden Markov Models delineating the putative inter-relationship of the GRAFS families. We show several common structural features indicating that the human GPCRs in the GRAFS families share a common ancestor.

abstract={G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest group of cell surface receptors in humans that signal in response to diverse inputs and regulate a plethora of cellular processes. Hence, they constitute one of the primary drug target classes. Progress in our understanding of GPCR dynamics, activation and signalling has opened new possibilities for selective drug development. A key advancement has been provided by the concept of biased agonism, which describes the ability of ligands acting at the same GPCR to elicit distinct cellular signalling profiles by preferentially stabilizing different active conformational states of the receptor. Application of this concept raises the prospect of 'designer' biased agonists as optimized therapeutics with improved efficacy and/or reduced side-effect profiles. However, this application will require a detailed understanding of the spectrum of drug actions and a structural understanding of the drug-receptor interactions that drive distinct pharmacologies. The recent revolution in GPCR structural biology provides unprecedented insights into ligand binding, conformational dynamics and the control of signalling outcomes. These insights, together with new approaches to multi-dimensional analysis of drug action, are allowing refined classification of drugs according to their pharmacodynamic profiles, which can be linked to receptor structure and predictions of preclinical drug efficacy.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose Some existing computational methods are used to infer protein targets of small molecules and can therefore be used to find new targets for existing drugs, with the goals of re-directing the molecule towards a different therapeutic purpose or explaining off-target effects due to multiple targeting. Inherent limitations, however, arise from the fact that chemical analogy is calculated on the basis of common frameworks or scaffolds and also because target information is neglected. The method we present addresses these issues by taking into account 3D information from both the ligand and the target. Experimental Approach ElectroShape is an established method for ultra-fast comparison of the shapes and charge distributions of ligands that is validated here for prediction of on-target activities, off-target profiles and adverse effects of drugs and drug-like molecules taken from the DrugBank database. Key Results The method is shown to predict polypharmacology profiles and relate targets from two complementary viewpoints (ligand- and target-based networks). Conclusions and Implications The open-access web tool presented here (http://ub.cbm.uam.es/chemogenomics/) allows interactive navigation in a unified ‘pharmacological space’ from the viewpoints of both ligands and targets. It also enables prediction of pharmacological profiles, including likely side effects, for new compounds. We hope this web interface will help many pharmacologists to become aware of this new paradigm (up to now mostly used in the realm of the so-called ‘chemical biology’) and encourage its use with a view to revealing ‘hidden’ relationships between new and existing compounds and pharmacologically relevant targets.},

These algorithms predict our ability to discover small molecule drugs for protein targets and can help in identifying promising new biological targets for small molecule drug discovery. However, in practice, nearly all druggability estimation methods are applied to protein crystal structures as rigid proteins, with protein flexibility often not directly addressed. The increasing interest in finding small molecule drugs to protein-protein interfaces makes this issue particularly acute since these interfaces tend to have substantial flexibility compared to traditional enzyme targets. Here, we apply an approach that accounts for light protein backbone movement and protein side-chain flexibility in protein binding sites. We present the results of applying this method to all publicly available mammalian protein crystal structures.},

abstract={Protein structures in the Protein Data Bank provide a wealth of data about the interactions that determine the native states of proteins. Using the probability theory, we derive an atomic distance-dependent statistical potential from a sample of native structures that does not depend on any adjustable parameters (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy, or DOPE). DOPE is based on an improved reference state that corresponds to noninteracting atoms in a homogeneous sphere with the radius dependent on a sample native structure; it thus accounts for the finite and spherical shape of the native structures. The DOPE potential was extracted from a nonredundant set of 1472 crystallographic structures. We tested DOPE and five other scoring functions by the detection of the native state among six multiple target decoy sets, the correlation between the score and model error, and the identification of the most accurate non-native structure in the decoy set. For all decoy sets, DOPE is the best performing function in terms of all criteria, except for a tie in one criterion for one decoy set. To facilitate its use in various applications, such as model assessment, loop modeling, and fitting into cryo-electron microscopy mass density maps combined with comparative protein structure modeling, DOPE was incorporated into the modeling package MODELLER-8.},

  abstract        = {BACKGROUND Promiscuity in molecular interactions between small-molecules, including drugs, and proteins is widespread. Such unintended interactions can be exploited to suggest drug repurposing possibilities as well as to identify potential molecular mechanisms responsible for observed side-effects. METHODS We perform a large-scale analysis to detect binding-site molecular interaction field similarities between the binding-sites of the primary target of 400 drugs against a dataset of 14082 cavities within 7895 different proteins representing a non-redundant dataset of all proteins with known structure. Statistically-significant cases with high levels of similarities represent potential cases where the drugs that bind the original target may in principle bind the suggested off-target. Such cases are further analysed with docking simulations to verify if indeed the drug could, in principle, bind the off-target. Diverse sources of data are integrated to associated potential cross-reactivity targets with side-effects. RESULTS We observe that promiscuous binding-sites tend to display higher levels of hydrophobic and aromatic similarities. Focusing on the most statistically significant similarities (Z-score ≥ 3.0) and corroborating docking results (RMSD {\textless} 2.0 {\AA}), we find 2923 cases involving 140 unique drugs and 1216 unique potential cross-reactivity protein targets. We highlight a few cases with a potential for drug repurposing (acetazolamide as a chorismate pyruvate lyase inhibitor, raloxifene as a bacterial quorum sensing inhibitor) as well as to explain the side-effects of zanamivir and captopril. A web-interface permits to explore the detected similarities for each of the 400 binding-sites of the primary drug targets and visualise them for the most statistically significant cases. CONCLUSIONS The detection of molecular interaction field similarities provide the opportunity to suggest drug repurposing opportunities as well as to identify potential molecular mechanisms responsible for side-effects. All methods utilized are freely available and can be readily applied to new query binding-sites. All data is freely available and represents an invaluable source to identify further candidates for repurposing and suggest potential mechanisms responsible for side-effects.},

  abstract        = {? 2015 American Chemical Society.(Figure Presented) Protein binding-site similarity detection methods can be used to predict protein function and understand molecular recognition, as a tool in drug design for drug repurposing and polypharmacology, and for the prediction of the molecular determinants of drug toxicity. Here, we present IsoMIF, a method able to identify binding site molecular interaction field similarities across protein families. IsoMIF utilizes six chemical probes and the detection of subgraph isomorphisms to identify geometrically and chemically equivalent sections of protein cavity pairs. The method is validated using six distinct data sets, four of those previously used in the validation of other methods. The mean area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) obtained across data sets for IsoMIF is higher than those of other methods. Furthermore, while IsoMIF obtains consistently high AUC values across data sets, other methods perform more erratically across data sets. IsoMIF can be used to predict function from structure, to detect potential cross-reactivity or polypharmacology targets, and to help suggest bioisosteric replacements to known binding molecules. Given that IsoMIF detects spatial patterns of molecular interaction field similarities, its predictions are directly related to pharmacophores and may be readily translated into modeling decisions in structure-based drug design. IsoMIF may in principle detect similar binding sites with distinct amino acid arrangements that lead to equivalent interactions within the cavity. The source code to calculate and visualize MIFs and MIF similarities are freely available.},

All the maximal cliques generated are output in a tree-like form. Subsequently, we prove that its worst-case time complexity is O (3n / 3) for an n-vertex graph. This is optimal as a function of n, since there exist up to 3n / 3 maximal cliques in an n-vertex graph. The algorithm is also demonstrated to run very fast in practice by computational experiments. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
